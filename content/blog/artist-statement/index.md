After 200 years, we decide to break open a time capsule and discover what happened after the first decade of the 21st century.  Since most of us have been conducting our existence staring into a portable light box, our decedents will find two artifacts composed of glass, plastic and metal that are out of battery.  That assumes the batteries havenâ€™t exploded and melted the phones.

Perhaps we will have a digital time capsule that will last forever, stored across multiple compute centers.  The amount of data will be so large as to make it difficult to parse by humans, but so small compared to the total data of the world.  That means only machines can interpret the data we pass down.

As an artist, I am using paint to create a durable record of the strange world that is now.  I do not want to capture the images that we want to remember, but of the images that we actually experience.  I want to interpret the modern mundane that we forget while we experience the world at gigabytes per second.  I want to create a still life of the internet.

Enjoy my site.  I have included not only my attempts at painting the internet, but also of practice paintings of various experiences along the way.  To find cohesive collections, visit the [tags](/tags) page.
