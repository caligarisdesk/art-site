# Cellular Detritus (series)

When a cell breaks, the proteins, the phospholipids, the DNA become unattached and begin to float away.  They break down, they react, they lose their structure and they disappear.  When looking in a microscope, we call these forgotten structures detritus.  They are food for other microbes so that the cycle of life can continue.

With our phones, we have a similar detritus.  We take pictures not only to capture treasured events, but, also, to remember.  At some point, our phones remind us to clean up old photos that no longer serve their purpose.  We photograph our license plate to remember it.  We take pictures of business cards so we will not need to carry them.  These captures of our world get deleted, but can become valuable recollections of our timeâ€”should we save them.  They are the truly accurate representations of our world, without filter.

In this collection, my goal is to create durable representations of the photos that get deleted.  I want these images to serve as a time capsule that would otherwise fade from memory and disk.
