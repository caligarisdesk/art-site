description: I painted an image submitted for an expense report

When I was looking through my phone’s old images, I found several receipts for expense reports.  I started to question what should become of these pictures.  Should I simply delete them or put them into archive?  They were accurate representations of places I had been and things I had done.  What should become of these hastily taken pictures?  This became the inspiration for my [#cellular-detritus](/tags/cellular-detritus/) series.

What if a forgettable image could be preserved as a time capsule and appreciated?  Receipts are flimsy.  They decompose and are quickly discarded.  We photograph them to make sure we are compensated, but after the expense report or reimbursement, they have no use.  I want to remember eating at the restaurant.  I don’t want to keep a shard of paper that disintegrates within a month.  This painting is my solution to the problem.

If you were wondering: no, I do not take pictures of my food.  I don't care how ornate or beautiful it is.  I am not going to photograph food.  It feels absolutely weird to me.  You are sacrificing the quality of your dish for no good reason.  In addition, everybody is doing it and posting the same dish over and over again.  That means what you are doing can be searched and rediscovered by just remembering the dish's name and place.  The point in painting a receipt is that nobody is going to post that.
