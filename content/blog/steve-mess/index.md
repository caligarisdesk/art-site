description: Steve makes a mess
---
He walked out of the room that day in a hurry to arrive home.  Exiting the door, he deftly checked to make sure it shut behind him.  As he waked into the elevator, he gazed upon his reflection on the silvery mirrors that lined the elevator walls.  A well manicured goatee.  A runner's posture.  A calm gaze.  A bell rang and his reflection gave way to a cold breeze running through the office lobby.

Steve did not know that two hours later he would be staring at the mess he had made of his kitchen.  The artisanally manufactured chocolate covered pistachio balls scattering across the stone kitchen tiles plotted a constellation of disappointment that reflected on his face.  They rolled dangerously close to the cats' food bowl, presenting simultaneously as nuisance and hazard.  The snack was pointless.  

Pointless.  As many of our attempts at satisfaction end without consummation, the pursuit of happiness in small chunks and large boulders can be fraught with spills and avalanches that go nowhere.  An apple pie ruined during cooling.  A clean towel soiled before use.  A small snack gone awry is cleaned away, but what of the pieces that escape the broom's sweep?  What vestiges will pose rancid offenses to a family's olfactory senses?  What bullets of chocolate threaten naive pets who mistake them for treats?

Steve exits the lobby into the freezing winter air.  As he makes his way to his car, what will he do, if he knew that a future small satisfaction will end in disappointment?  There is a bigger prize to seize.
